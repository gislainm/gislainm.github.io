        MyFin is every student's friend when it comes to financial literacy and customized<br>
        student loan payment plans that minimize interest paid on those loans. There is an<br>
        overwhelming number of american college grads paying hefty interest on their student loans.<br>
        What's more troubling is that most students sign up for these loans with no sophisticated <br>
        knowledge of how loans and interest on those loans work.

        There is multiple companies out there doing similar to what MyFin intends to do<br>
        but most of those companies charges users for their services. Some of these companies<br>
        are <a href="https://care4yourfuture.org" target="_blank">care4yourfuture</a> and <a
            href="https://www.salliemae.com" target="_blank">salliemae</a>.<br>
        MyFin Intends to be a free of charge service available to all students, and it will help<br>
        understand they student loans and assist them in creating a feasible payment plan that is<br>
        less burdensome and saves them money in the long run by minimizing the interest they have <br>
        to pay on their loans.
