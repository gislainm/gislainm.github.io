    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>My name is N. Gislain Muhikira. I am currenly a student at <abbr
            title="Maharishi International University">M.I.U</abbr> and I am<br>
        pursuing a masters degree in SoftwareDevelopment. I have a bachelor's of<br>
        Science in Food Science and Technology from <abbr title="The University of Nebraska-Lincoln">U.N.L</abbr>. I am
        passionate about<br>
        building useful tools that actually solve problems that people face on a daily basis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to my transition in the software development field, I worked for a genomic company<br>
        as a laboratory technician. In this job I learned a lot of things and sharpened my lab<br>
        technique. Ultimately I decided to transition into a different career path because<br>
        because I wanted a more challenging experience, and a career that would give me an opportunity<br>
        to create useful techinical solution for real world problems.
